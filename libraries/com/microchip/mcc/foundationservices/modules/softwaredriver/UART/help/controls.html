                The UART module is abstraction module that caters to instances of the Universal Synchronous and asynchronous receiver and transmitter
(USART) modules that is present in PIC and AVR devices. The USART is used to transfer data from one device to the other.
A USART is able to transmit a byte stream on an I/O pin (the TX pin), 
and receive a byte stream on another I/O pin (the RX pin). The rate 
at which bits are shifted out on the I/O pins is called the baud rate.
The baud rate can be selected by the user, and configured in MCC and START.

In general, the USART can operate in:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Asynchronous mode</li>
                    <li>Synchronous mode</li>
                </ul>
The USARTs are able to generate interrupts when a byte has been 
transmitter or received. A USART driver can therefore either be:
                <ul type="interruptmode">
                    <li>Polled</li>
                    <li>Interrupt mode</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
			The receiver uses the baud rate setting to recover the individual bits.

		The transmitter uses an additional I/O pin, the XCK pin, to transmit a bit clock. The receiver uses the
                XCK info to sample the incoming bits.

                The driver must poll the USARTs status register to detect when a byte has been received or transmitted. Based 
                on the result of the polling, the driver will write the next byte to be transmitted (TX data) or read the received byte 
                (RX data) from the USART.
            </p>

            <p>
                The USART issues an interrupt when a byte has been received or transmitted. The driver's Interrupt 
                Service Routine (ISR) will write TX the next data or read RX data from the USART. The RX and TX data are typically placed 
                in circular buffers (ringbuffers).

                The USART Basic driver usually uses some sort of hardware that implements USART functionality, even though it is 
                possible to implement a software USART implemented by bit-banging I/O pins.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Different MCUs have USART hardware with different names and functionalities, such as UART, USART, USI etc. In START, the user 
                selects a device and adds the USART Basic driver. A device may have several possible hardware resources available for 
                the driver, such as USART0, USART1 etc. In this case the user must select which one to use.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The configuration options in START displays options that are dependent on the hardware used to implement the USART driver.
                For example, an option may allow changing the baud rate used to drive the underlying USART hardware.

                The interrupt-driven configurations use the interrupt functionality of the underlying USART hardware. Make sure that global interrupts 
                are enabled (using sei()) and that the Interrupt Controller, if present, is configured so that any interrupts are serviced correctly.

            <p>
			Many Timeout implementations use the interrupt functionality of the underlying hardware timer. Make sure that global interrupts
			are enabled (using INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable()) and that the Interrupt Controller, if present, is configured so
			that the timer interrupt is serviced correctly.
