            <p>
                The serial peripheral interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication
                interface.
            </p>                
            <p>                 
                SPI devices communicate in full duplex mode using a master-slave
                architecture with a single master. The master device originates the frame for
                reading and writing. Multiple slave devices are supported through selection
                with individual slave select (SS) lines.
            </p>                
            <p> 
                The driver provides basic SPI functionality,
                that is:
            </p>                                
                    <ul type="func">
                        <li>Transmission of a byte or block of bytes</li>
                        <li>Reception of a byte or block of bytes</li>
                        <li>Support for open()/close() interface to allow multiple processes share one SPI bus</li>
                    </ul>
                                                
                The SPI driver has four modes of operation:
                    <ul type="mode">
                        <li>Master polled mode</li>
                        <li>Slave polled mode</li>
                        <li>Master interrupt-driven mode</li>
                        <li>Slave interrupt-driven mode</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="DriverConfiguration" name="driverConfiguration">Driver Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                The SPI driver is configured using MCC/START. The user can 
                choose from the four modes of operation (master/slave, polled/IRQ).
                MCC/START also allows the user to select SCK frequency, data order, 
                data polarity and data phase.
            </p>                
            <p>                
                The SPI must be opened by calling <component_name>_open() before 
                it can be used. After use, the SPI is closed by calling 
                <component_name>_close(). A call to <component_name>_open() for a SPI 
                which is already open will return a *false* value, indicating that the 
                SPI is already busy on behalf of another process.
            </p>                
            <p>                 
                If several SPI hardware instances are available on the device, 
                the user can select which SPI instance the driver shall use.
            </p>

            <h3 id="masterMode" name="MasterMode">Master mode</h3>
            <p>
                When in master mode, the SPI generates the SCK clock. Data is 
                driven out on the MOSI I/O pin according to the configured phase and 
                polarity.
            </p>
            <h3 id="slaveMode" name="SlaveMode">Slave mode</h3>
            <p>
                When in slave mode, the SPI receives the SCK clock from the 
                master and uses this to sample data on the MOSI I/O pin. The
                phase and polarity must be configured according to the values 
                used by the master.
            </p>
            <h3 id="polledMode" name="PolledMode">Polled mode</h3>
            <p>
                The polled mode version of the driver provides functions for : 
                <ul type="blockingFunc">
                    <li>transmitting and receiving one byte of data</li>
                    <li>transmitting and receiving one block of data. The same buffer holds both
                        data to be transmitted and received data. The received bytes overwrites the 
                        transmitted bytes after they have been transmitted</li>
                    <li>transmitting one block of data. Received bytes are discarded</li>
                    <li>receiving one block of data. A number of bytes identical to the block size 
                        is shifted out of the SPI. These bytes have the value 0x00</li>
                </ul>                
            </p>
            <p>
                All these functions are blocking: The functions will not return 
                before the operations have completed.
            </p>
            <h3 id="iRQMode" name="IRQMode">IRQ mode</h3>
            <p>
                The IRQ mode version of the driver provides functions for : 
                <ul type="irqFunc">
                    <li>transmitting and receiving one byte of data</li>
                    <li>transmitting and receiving one block of data. The same buffer holds both
                        data to be transmitted and received data. The received bytes overwrites the 
                        transmitted bytes after they have been transmitted</li>
                    <li>transmitting one block of data. Received bytes are discarded</li>
                    <li>receiving one block of data. A number of bytes identical to the block size 
                        is shifted out of the SPI. These bytes have the value 0x00</li>
                    <li>check if SPI bus is IDLE</li>
                    <li>check if SPI bus is BUSY</li>
                    <li>check if SPI bus is DONE</li>
                </ul>                
            </p>
            <p>                
                The functions checking the SPI bus status are included in the 
                interrupt driven driver to allow the application to know the state 
                of the SPI transfer. They are not needed in the polled driver since
                this driver blocks until the operation has completed. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="sPIBusState" name="SPIBusState">SPI bus state</h3>
            <p>
                The SPI bus is in one of the states listed in \ref spi_transfer_status_t.
                The bus state is used by the exchange one byte function: This function 
                will wait until the SPI bus is no longer BUSY before exchanging a byte. 
                This allows the exchange byte function to work seamlessly with the 
                exchange, receive and transmit block functions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="iRQCallbacks" name="IRQCallbacks">IRQ callbacks</h3>
            <p>
                In IRQ mode, the ISR can be configured to call a callback function 
                before exiting. This is done by calling the function 
                <component_name>_register_callback() with a pointer to the callback 
                function as parameter. Registering a NULL pointer as callback causes 
                no callback function to be called. NULL is the default value of the 
                callback function pointer.
            </p>
            <p>                
                A callback function is typically used to:
                <ul type="irqFunc"></ul>                
                  <li>In master mode: Release SS after transfer as finished.</li>
                  <li>In slave mode: Implement a chosen SPI protocol, setting up 
                    next transfer after the previous one (i.e. data transfer 
                    phase after control/command phase)</li>
              </ul>                      
            </p>
            <h3 id="slaveSelect" name="SlaveSelect">Slave Select</h3>
            <p>
                A SPI master usually controls a Slave Select pin to choose the 
                slave to communicate with. The SPI driver does not manipulate 
                the Slave Select (SS_bar) I/O pin. If the user wants to control 
                SS_bar before and after a transfer, this has to be done using 
                normal I/O port operations.
            </p>
            <h3 id="usingConfigurations" name="UsingConfigurations">Using configurations</h3>
            <p>
                The <component_name>_open()-function takes a parameter, namely the name 
                of the *configuration* to use when opening the SPI. A *configuration*
                is a set of SPI-related parameters such as SCK frequency, SPI 
                phase and polarity etc. The parameters controlled by a configuration
                depends on the underlying hardware the SPI Basic driver uses.
            </p>
            <p>                   
                Different configurations allows the SPI to use one setup when 
                communicating with one SPI slave, and another configuration 
                when communicating with another slave. As an example, assume
                a SPI system with one master and two slaves SLAVE_A and SLAVE_B.
                <ul type="irqFunc"></ul>                
                    <li>SLAVE_A is slow, so requires a slow SCK rate for communication</li>
                    <li>SLAVE_B is fast, so can use a fast SCK rate for communication</li>
                </ul>                     
            </p>
            <p>                       
                To open a connection to SLAVE_A, the master would call 
                <component_name>_open(SLAVE_A), to open a connection to SLAVE_B, 
                <component_name>_open(SLAVE_B) would be called.
                These calls would reconfigure the SPI hardware appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>                   
                The SPI Basic driver provides one configuration named DEFAULT. 
                This is the configuration that the user configured in MCC/START. 
                The user can provide additional configurations by modifying 
                spi.c and spi.h appropriately.
            </p>

            <h3 id="hardwareDependencies" name="hardwareDependencies">Hardware Dependencies</h3>
            <p>
                The SPI Basic driver usually uses some sort of hardware 
                that implements SPI functionality, even though it is 
                possible to implement a software SPI implemented by bit-banging 
                I/O pins.
            </p>
            <p>              
                Different MCUs have SPI hardware with different names and 
                functionalities, such as MSSP, SPI, UART, USI etc. In MCC/START, the user 
                selects a device and adds the SPI driver. A device
                may have several possible hardware resources available for 
                the driver, such as SPI0, SPI1 etc. In this case the user 
                must select which one to use.
            </p>
            <p>              
                The configuration options in MCC/START displays options that are 
                dependent on the hardware used to implement the SPI driver.
                For example, an option may allow changing the baud rate 
                used to drive the underlying SPI hardware.

                The interrupt-driven configurations use the interrupt functionality 
                of the underlying SPI hardware. Make sure that global interrupts 
                are enabled and that the Interrupt Controller, if 
                present, is configured so that any interrupts are serviced 
                correctly.
