                The Timeout driver is part of the Foundation Services HAL driver library, it has two modes of operation: 
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>Scheduler mode</li>
                    <li>Stopwatch mode</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="schedulerMode" name="schedulerMode">Scheduler mode</h3>
            <p>
			The Scheduler mode allows timer tasks to be scheduled a specified number of timer ticks from now. A
			timer task is a piece of code (i.e. a function) executed at a specific time by the timer after the task has
			been added to the timers task queue. The execution delay or period is set in ticks, where one tick is
			defined as a configurable number of clock cycles in the hardware timer implementing the Timeout driver.
			Changing the number of clock cycles in a tick (by changing the timer prescaler) changes execution delays
			for all tasks in the queue.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 id="stopWatchMode" name="stopWatchMode">Stopwatch mode</h3>
            <p>
            The Stopwatch mode allows the program to start the stopwatch, do some operation, then stop the
			stopwatch and measure the duration of the operation.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4 id="functionalDescription" name="functionalDescription">Functional Description</h4>
            <p>
            The Timeout Driver uses structures and linked-list implementations to perform functionalities such as
			creating, adding, and deleting timers. The term "timer" that we will be referring to in this documentation is
			represented by a structure timerStruct_t. Timer tasks can be scheduled for execution at a specified time 
			by adding them to a scheduler queue. Tasks are added to the scheduler queue using the timeout_create()-function. 
			This places the timer task, or more precisely, it's timer struct at the correct place in a sorted linked list. 
			The list is sorted by the task's scheduled time for	execution. The task to execute first is at the head of the list. 
			The linked list will have as may elements as there are tasks scheduled for execution.
            </p>
			<p>
			Once the specified number of ticks has passed, the task is scheduled for execution. When this happens,
			the timer struct is removed from the linked list, and the task's callback function and it's payload is placed
			in another queue; the callback queue. Note that the callback function is not called automatically, the user
			software must execute the callbacks in the callback queue using timeout_call_next_callback(). 
			If no task has been scheduled for execution, this function returns immediately, so there is no need for any polling.
			Using the timeout_call_next_callback() function instead of executing the callback immediately
			allows the user code to check for pending callbacks and executing them at appropriate points in time, so
			the execution won't disturb any timing-critical part of the application.
			</p>
			<p>
			The task's callback function returns a value of type uint32_t. If this value is zero, the task will not
			be rescheduled automatically. If this return value is non-null, the task will be automatically rescheduled for
			execution after the number of ticks specified in the return value.
			</p>
			<p>
			The stopwatch functionality is implemented using the same linked list as the scheduler mode. Multiple
			stopwatches may be active at the same time. A variable of type timerStruct_t is used to hold
			housekeeping information for each stopwatch. The linked list may hold timer structs of both scheduler
			and stopwatch functionality at any time. A stopwatch cannot count longer than (timer_maximum range)/2.
			After this point the stopwatch will automatically stop.

            <p>
            The Timeout driver needs some sort of hardware that is able to measure a time interval. In MCUs, this is
			typically implemented using some sort of timer/counter. Different MCUs have timers with different names
			and functionalities, such as TMR0, TMR1/3/5, TMR2/4/6 etc. When the user has selected a device and
			added the timeout driver, the Select timer field in the Hardware Settings pane in MCC will let the user select
			the available hardware instances to use for implementing the Timeout functionality.
            </p>
			<p>
			The corresponding selection will add the hardware instance of timer selected into the project resources. the user can set
			many settings according to his need. For example, an option may allow changing the clock or prescaling used to
			drive the underlying timer hardware.

            <h3 id="softwareDependencies" name="softwareDependencies">Software dependencies</h3>
            <p>
			Many Timeout implementations use the interrupt functionality of the underlying hardware timer. Make sure that global interrupts
			are enabled (using INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable()) and that the Interrupt Controller, if present, is configured so
			that the timer interrupt is serviced correctly.
            </p>
