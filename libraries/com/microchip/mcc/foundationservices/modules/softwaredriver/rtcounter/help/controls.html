                The RTCounter is part of the Foundation Services HAL driver library, it has two modes of operation:

            <p>
            It is important to note The RTCounter Software Library uses structures and linked-list implementation to perform 
            functionalities such as creating, adding, and deleting timers. The term "timer" that we will be 
            referring to in this discussion is represented by a structure rtcountStruct. Timer tasks can be scheduled for execution 
            at a specified time by adding them to a scheduler queue. Tasks are added to the scheduler queue using the rtcount_create() function. 
            This places the timer task, or more precisely, its struct at the correct place in a sorted linked list. 
            The list is sorted by the task's scheduled time for	execution. The task to execute first is at the head of the list. 
            The linked list will have as may elements as there are tasks scheduled for execution.

            The RTCounter needs some sort of hardware that is able to measure a time interval. In MCUs, this is
            typically implemented using some sort of timer/counter. Different MCUs have timers with different names
            and functionalities, such as TMR0, TMR1/3/5, TMR2/4/6 etc. When the user has selected a device and
            added the RTCounter, the Select timer field in the Hardware Settings pane in MCC will let the user select
            the available hardware instances to use for implementing the Timeout functionality.
            </p>
			<p>
			The corresponding selection will add the hardware instance of timer selected into the project resources. the user can set
			many settings according to his need. For example, an option may allow changing the clock or prescaling used to
			drive the underlying timer hardware.

            <p>
			Many RTCounter implementations use the interrupt functionality of the underlying hardware timer. Make sure that global interrupts
			are enabled (using INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable()) and that the Interrupt Controller, if present, is configured so
			that the timer interrupt is serviced correctly.
