        <h2>FatFS Driver Table Configuration</h2>
        This section corresponds to just the driver table configuration.  This table makes up the <a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/doc/config.html#volumes">FF_VOLUMES</a>, <a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/doc/config.html#volume_strs">FF_VOLUME_STRS</a>, as well as the generating the code required for the disk access in the diskio.c file. 
        <BR><BR>There are two main sections to the driver table:
                <BR><ol><li>The table of already loaded drivers.</li>
                        <li>The controls for adding a new driver.
                    </ol></BR>

        <section>
            <h2 id="table" name="table">1. Driver Table</h2>
            <p>
                The driver table contains all of the loaded driver information. It shows what drives are loaded, their driver number, their drive label, and the name of the driver associated to drive. The table is interactive.  Once a driver is added to the table, the drive label and number of that drive can be modified by clicking on the corresponding cell and editing the data.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="table_controls" name="table_controls">2. Driver Table Controls</h2>
            <p>
                The driver table controls allows users to add/remove drive selection from the table. Each drive added to the table must have a unique drive number, a unique drive label, and select a driver to use for that physical layer.
            </p>
            
            <h3 id="drive_number" name="drive_number">Drive Number</h3>
            <p>
                The drive number field specifies the number that will be used for this drive in the FatFs file system. The drive number is used when using absolute paths to access a file/folder - e.g. f_open("0:/HELLO.TXT").  
                <br>This field must be:<ul>
                        <li>A number 0-9</li>
                        <li>Sequential starting from 0</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>When a field is deleted from the table, all existing drive numbers will be adjusted to fit these rules.  
                <br>When a drive number is changed in the middle of a table, the drive numbers before/after the modified drive will all be shifted to fit these rules.
            </p>
            <h3 id="drive_label" name="drive_label">Drive Label</h3>
            <p>
                When the <a href="config_drives.html#volume_id_format">Volume ID Style</a> is set to either 1 or 2, the volume label can also be used to reference files/folders - e.g. f_open("drive_label:/HELLO.TXT").  The drive label is also used in the generated diskio.c file to help create an association between the user selections and the generated code.
                <br>This field should be:<ul>
                        <li>Alpha-numeric only</li>
                        <li>Unique</li>
                    </ul>
					<br>Click on a cell in this column to edit the drive label name.
            </p>
            <h3 id="drive_driver" name="drive_driver">Firmware Driver</h3>
            <p>
                The driver list box is a list of all the available firmware drivers that support the sector operations required by the FatFs library. A template example driver is provided that will create just skeleton functions available to fill in when a driver is not available for the desired physical media in MCC.
            </p>
            <h3 id="insert_drive" name="insert_drive">Insert</h3>
            <p>
                This button will insert a row into the driver table with the selected driver as the physical layer.  Once inserted the drive label and number associated with that driver can be manually edited by selecting the corresponding cell.
            </p>
            <h3 id="remove_drive" name="delete_drive">Remove Selected Drive</h3>
            <p>
                This button will remove the row corresponding to the button pressed.  NOTE: this may not unload the drivers associated with driver.  This must be done manually at present.
