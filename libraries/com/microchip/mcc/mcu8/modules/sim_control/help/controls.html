                                The SIM_CONTROL graphical interface allows you to select simultaneous PWM start through the Enable Simultaneously checkbox.
                                After doing this, the individual signal checkboxes will also be enabled and you will be able to select which PWM outputs you want to drive simultaneously.
                                A warning will be thrown in the Notifications tab for each PWM signal you select, letting you know that you need to enable the corresponding PWM module and configure it.
                                Once you have enabled a PWM module, the afferent warning will disappear.

                                Writing to these registers is, therefore, not immediate but delayed until arming conditions are valid.
                                In the graphical interface of the PWM module you can select between immediate or triggered arming in the PWM Reload section.
