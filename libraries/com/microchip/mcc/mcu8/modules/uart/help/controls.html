The baud rate can be selected on the Easy Setup tab, or on the Registers tab, the registers that control the baud rate can be set directly.  The behavior of MCC is different depending on the method used to set the baud rate.Setting the baud rate from the Easy Setup window, MCC will always use the desired baud rate setting to findan actual baud that is closest to the desired baud rate.  If the System Clock is later changed in MCC, the desired baud rate will not change.MCC will again search for an actual baud that is closest to the desired baud, based on the new System Clock value.Setting the baud rate by configuring the registers from the Registers window, MCC will discard desired baud rate. The baud rate dropdown box will display the actual baud rate that will be produced from the register settings. The register settings that control the baud rate will not be changed by MCC.  If The System Clock is later changed in MCC,the new actual baud rate will be calculated and shown in the Baud Rate dropdown box. </td>
