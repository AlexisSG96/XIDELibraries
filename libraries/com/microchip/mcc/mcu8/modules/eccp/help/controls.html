                                In Capture mode, the timer is used in counter mode; in capture mode, the timer is left free-running to match a predefined value; in PWM mode, the timer period forms the base of the PWM period.
                                When you make a timer selection a notification will pop-up in the notifications tab, letting you know you need to load and configure the timer you assigned to the ECCP module.
                                Once you have loaded the timer module, the notification will change its type from Warning to Info, serving as a reminder you have assigned that timer module to the ECCP module.
                                As a particular case, in the PWM mode, for each timer selected and loaded, the PWM Parameters section is updated with data (period, frequency, resolution) calculated based on information collected from the timer you selected.
