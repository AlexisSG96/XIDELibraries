                            <td>In both methods, the CRC algorithm will split an input string into separate characters to which it would add a number of extra zero bits.
                                In order to avoid processing these augmented zero bits, you can shift and XOR the input with the CRC. 
                                Mathematically speaking, the Direct method can be expressed as: (x^n Ã— inputString) mod P(x), where n = order of polynomial P(x), so x^n is in fact the zero bits augmentation done by a left-shift by n bits operation.
                                The Indirect method can be expressed as: augmentedInputString mod P(x), where augmentedInputString is the inputString shifted by n bits.
                                Both algorithms are identical if the inputString is processed all at once. When dividing it into blocks of data, these blocks may be processed independently and the summed output may vary. 
                                In the direct method all blocks would be augmented by n zeros, while in the indirect method only the last block would be augmented by n zeros.
