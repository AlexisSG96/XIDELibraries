                                This is crucial for time-dependent peripherals and, though it may be left unchanged if you don't use time-dependent modules, you are strongly encouraged to fill it in to match your actual application.
                                The input format is [Number][units], where units = Hz, kHz, MHz. Using a value greater than the device maximum frequency will result into a warning in the Notifications tab.
                                Using an input string non-compliant with this format will yield the input box invalid and blinking red until the input becomes valid again or the focus is shifted.
